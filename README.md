## Languages
What is a language? It is simple. A set of strings. Now the question is obvious. What are strings? Strings are a sequence of simbol of an alphabet. Mathematically we denote with this simbol $\ \Sigma$ an alphabet, and with $\ \Sigma^*$ all the strings from the alphabet. </br>

Now we can define formally a language given an alphabet $\ \Sigma$ like the set $\ L= ( w \mid  w \in  \Sigma ^* )$ </br>

Example: $\ \Sigma =${ 0,1 }, $\ L=${11,01,1}

## Grammars
Grammars generate languages. Formally a grammar is a quadruple $\ G = (V,T,P,S) $
- V is the set of non-terminal symbols
- T is the set of terminal symbols
- S is the initial non-terminal symbol
- P is a set of productions

What is a production? Simple a rule that allows you to replace the left side with the right. 
Formally a production is $\ \alpha A \beta -> \alpha \gamma \beta A \in V $, e $\ \alpha, \gamma ,\beta \in (V \cup T )^*$
