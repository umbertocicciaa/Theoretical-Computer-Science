## Languages
What is a language? It is simple. A set of strings. Now the question is obvious. What are strings? Strings are a sequence of simbol of an alphabet. Mathematically we denote with this simbol $\Sigma$ an alphabet, and with $\Sigma^*$ all the strings from the alphabet. </br>

Now we can define formally a language given an alphabet $\Sigma$ like the set $L= ( w \mid  w \in  \Sigma ^* )$ </br>

Example: $\Sigma =${ 0,1 }, $L=${11,01,1}

## Grammars
Grammars generate languages. Formally a grammar is a quadruple $G = (V,T,P,S)$
- V is the set of non-terminal symbols
- T is the set of terminal symbols
- S is the initial non-terminal symbol
- P is a set of productions

What is a production? Simple a rule that allows you to replace the left side with the right. 
Formally a production is $\alpha A \beta => \alpha \gamma \beta$ e $A \in V$, e 
$`\alpha , \gamma , \beta \in (V \cup T )^*`$, With $(V \cup T )^*$ we identify strings of non-terminal and terminal symbols.

### Chomsky hierarchy

We can divide grammars in 4 types base on the language they generate:
- Type 3 grammar: grammar production are of the type, $`A => a`$ &nbsp;  $`A \in V,\ a \in T `$ &nbsp; $`A => Ba, A,B \in V, a \in T`$ &nbsp; $`A => aB, A,B \in V, a \in T`$
- Type 2 grammar: grammar production are of the type, $`A => \Gamma `$ &nbsp;  $`A \in V, \Gamma \in (V \cup T)^*`$
- Type 0 grammar: grammar production are of the type, $`\alpha A \beta => \alpha \gamma \beta`$ &nbsp; $`A \in V`$, &nbsp; $`\alpha , \gamma , \beta \in (V \cup T )^*`$
