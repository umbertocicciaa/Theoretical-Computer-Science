## Languages
What is a language? It is simple. A set of strings. Now the question is obvious. What are strings? Strings are a sequence of simbol of an alphabet. Mathematically we denote with this simbol $\ \Sigma$ an alphabet, and with $\ \Sigma^*$ all the strings from the alphabet. </br>

Now we can define formally a language given an alphabet $\ \Sigma$ like the set $\ L= ( w \mid  w \in \Sigma^* ) $ </br>

Example: $\ \Sigma =${ 0,1 }, $\ L=${11,01,1}
